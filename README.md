# AudioSignalProcessor
scientifically analyse audio signals 


This project will take wav format files and anaylse them to find: 
- frequencies
- amplitude
- harmonics
- reconstruction of the wave form 

To do: 
- create a realtime update to the sound 
- turn this into some sort of instrumenet 
- hoping to use Linux for this to become a dedicated sound engine 


Current plan: 
- I have scientifice questions to answer on the aliasing 
- I still need to undersatndthe benefit of the numpy array 
- going to have a look at what fifo files do and if i can use this to have a stream of sounds
